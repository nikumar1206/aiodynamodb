# aiodynamodb


ideas:
 - use a client to put/get/delete/query
 - bake serialization and deserialization in the model
 - remember to dela with the decimal deserialization issue
 - maybe model the filters
 - evaluate serializing models as json to have something like Pynamo Json field
 - Create a new pydantic field with hash/range key?
